That's a fantastic project! You've put together a great README with a lot of detail, which is exactly what makes a good open-source project.

Since the project is already deployed, it's a good idea to add that information to the README as well. This makes it easy for others to see the live project immediately.

Here is the updated README with the deployment link and a few minor tweaks for clarity and consistency.

🧠 Machine Learning Model
The backend uses:

TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity for recommendations.

Built with scikit-learn & pandas.

Content-based engine trained on genres, cast, keywords, director, tagline from local CSV data.

⚙️ How to Run Locally

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/batman-movie-recommender.git
cd batman-movie-recommender
Backend (FastAPI + ML Model) Setup

Navigate to the backend directory: cd movie-backend

Install Python dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
(Ensure you have a requirements.txt file in your movie-backend directory).

Place your dataset: Ensure your movie data file, movies.csv, is located in this directory.

Start the FastAPI server: uvicorn main:app --reload
The server will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Frontend (React) Setup

Open a new terminal window.

Navigate to the frontend directory: cd movie-frontend

Install Node.js dependencies: npm install

Start the React development server: npm start
The app will launch in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
